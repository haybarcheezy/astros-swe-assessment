## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

**Option 1: VS Code Dev Containers (Recommended)**

- Docker or Docker Desktop
- VS Code with [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

**Option 2: Traditional Local Setup**

- Python 3.11+
- Node.js 18+
- npm, yarn, or bun

### Development with VS Code Dev Containers (Recommended)

**Setup Steps:**

1. **Install Prerequisites:**
   - Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) or [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Install the [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

2. **Open the Project:**
   Open the project folder in vscode or through the terminal:

   ```bash
   # Clone your forked repository
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd tech-assessment-staff-swe

   # Open the project in VS Code
   code .
   ```

3. **Start Dev Containers:**
   - VS Code will detect the dev container configuration
   - Click "Reopen in Container" when prompted (or use `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container")
   - VS Code will build and start both backend and frontend containers
   - Dependencies will be automatically installed
   - This may take a few minutes on first run

4. **Start Development:**
   - Backend will be available at: http://localhost:5001
   - Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000
   - Code changes will automatically be reflected in the frontend and backend via hot-reload.

**Working with Dev Containers:**

- All VS Code extensions (Python, Pylance, ESLint, etc.) are automatically installed
- To rebuild containers: `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
- To view logs of the frontend or backend, first open a terminal outsides of the devcontainer and then you can run `docker logs baseball-stats-frontend -f` or `docker logs baseball-stats-backend -f`
- When done working with the containers, they should automatically stop running once the vscode editor is closed.
  - To manually kill the containers first run `docker ps` to check if they are still running and then use `docker kill <name of container>` to stop them.

**Troubleshooting:**

- **Container won't start:** Ensure Docker is running
- **Dependencies not installed:** Rebuild the container (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Rebuild Container")
- **Port conflicts:** Stop any local services running on ports 5001 or 3000

### Traditional Local Development Setup

**Fork and navigate to the project:**

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd tech-assessment-staff-swe
```

**Backend Setup:**

```bash
cd backend

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
source venv\Scripts\activate # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate     # On macOS/Linux

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the backend server
flask --app main run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5001 --debug
```

Backend will be available at: http://localhost:5001

**Frontend Setup (in a new terminal):**

```bash
cd frontend

# Install dependencies using npm/yarn/bun/etc.
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Frontend will be available at: http://localhost:3000

## Running Tests

### Backend Tests

```bash
cd backend
# in dev container make sure to activate the virtual environment in the backend directory via: source .venv/bin/activate
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

### Frontend Tests

```bash
cd frontend
npm test # if using the dev container this will be 'bun test' instead
```

**Note:** For complete field documentation, see the [Baseball Savant CSV Documentation](https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/csv-docs).

In the backend, the db models and schemas are already implemented for you. You may edit them as you see fit.
The pitches model and schema only include a subset of all the fields from the pitches table, you are free to add more if wanted.

**Schemas:** Marshmallow schemas for both tables are already implemented in `backend/app/schemas.py`.

**Models:** SqlAlchemy models are created in `backend/app/main.py`.

## Frontend

A starting point has been created to implement a player table and its filters. Feel free to restructure the code as you see fit and create any other components that will be needed.

## Next Steps for Implementation

1. Finish the React components and API integration
2. Add comprehensive error handling and validation
3. Complete the test suites
4. Add styling and improve user experience

## Bonus Features (Optional)

If you finish the core requirements early or want to demonstrate additional skills, consider implementing:

- Advanced filtering and sorting in the UI
- Data export functionality
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback
- Input validation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Additional test coverage
- Set up logging and monitoring

## Time Management Notes

This assessment is designed to take 2-3 hours. Focus on:

- Core functionality (upload, store, display)
- Code quality and structure
- Basic testing
- Clear documentation

Don't worry about:

- Production-ready security
- Advanced UI/UX features
- Comprehensive error scenarios
- Performance optimization

## Questions or Issues

If you encounter any setup issues or have questions about the requirements, please include them in your submission documentation.
